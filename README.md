# Financial Calculator

This program will allow the user to access two different financial calculators: and investement and a home loan calculator.
I created this program to help out this company with creating this calculator.

## How to use and navigate through the project

You need to follow instructions correctly, firstly choose which calculator you want to use(bond or investment)
Lets say that the user selects investment, the user is required to input the following:
1. The amount of money that they are depositing.
1. The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number
of the interest rate should be entered — don’t worry
about having to deal with the added ‘%’, e.g. The user
should enter 8 and not 8%.
1. The number of years they plan on investing for.
1. Then ask the user to input whether they want “simple”or compound interest.
After the user has entered all that is required then your answer will be printed.

If the user selects bond, they need to input the following:
1. The present value of the house. E.g. 100000
1. The interest rate. E.g. 7
1. The number of months they plan to take to repay the
bond. E.g. 120
Thereafter calculations will be made and the answer presented to the user.
